This is going to extend the learning07 branch of my main stata repo, with
commit 8a5d26a from April 26 2011.

These models estimate the unexpected portion of changes in test scores in 2002 (math
and reading separaely) by regressing 2002 scores on 1997 scores ad time, as
well as various other controls.  The main result of the table is the result of
regressing some type of 2002 time with a child on the residual from he first
stage.
